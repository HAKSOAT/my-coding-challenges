# Coding challenges
In this repository, I store my solutioins to the common programming problems. Currently I try to implement each solution in Python and Java, maybe sometimes C++. That is, I can compare languages with respect to implementations

The solutions in this repo are not meant to be the best ones. You may find better solutions out there. What is more, you can come up with your own solution which can be considered as the best one. Bear in mind that in practice optimal solution depends on various parameters such as data and problem situation etc.
